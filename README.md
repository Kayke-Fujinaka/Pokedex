## :page_facing_up: Describe

This is a pokedex page that showcases six different Pokemons: Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Charmander, Gyarados, Gengar, and Dragonite.

JavaScript was used to create the application, which allows users to access the card of each Pokemon, displaying their unique attack and point values.

The project was developed in collaboration with the YouTube channel Dev em Dobro during a special event.
